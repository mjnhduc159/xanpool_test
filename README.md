## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### 1. Assets folder
The assets folder contains images and scss folder for styling. In this project architecture, I am using centralized styling with SCSS files. I am more comfortable with that.

If you prefer to include style in each component, that's not a problem. But, you should consider locating a default or shared styling here.

You can rename it to css or styles if you don't use scss/sass in your project.
